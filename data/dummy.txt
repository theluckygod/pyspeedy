The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
The cake was a lie.
The stars are shining brightly tonight.
The book was better than the movie.
The early bird catches the worm.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
All that glitters is not gold.
